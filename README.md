# IDEATION PHASE

This app is going to be something to manage kanban, so a kanban board app

So its a one page app, left to right is the kanban thingy
- Doing
- Waiting
- Review
- Done

There's also another page which shows all the done tasks, arranged in a table. 
The table can be downloaded.

Each board is like container for cards of certain 'state'. 

Each card has a state to show which status they are currently in. 

Card design:
- Task name
- Task description
- Person in charge
- Date started
- Deadline
- Status

clicking the card will open modal and show all the details of the task, in a form.
The form can be edited. Then there's a cancel and save changes button.
There's also a delete button, which the task will be deleted permanently.

There's a forward and backward button for each card, so that it can be popped around the kanban board

The done tab will only display fix amount of done items. At the bottom, there's a open all button to show all the tasks done in tabular form.
